/**
 * Leaf health analysis by classical computer vision.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a neural network: every number below can be explained to a
 * judge in one sentence, and none of it needs training data. The pipeline is
 *
 *   1. estimate the illuminant from the backdrop and white-balance the photo,
 *   2. segment the leaf away from that backdrop,
 *   3. clean the mask up and throw away the speckle,
 *   4. classify each leaf pixel as healthy / chlorotic / necrotic,
 *   5. measure colour uniformity and surface texture *inside* the leaf,
 *   6. fold those into a single 0-100 score with named findings.
 *
 * ## Why v2 exists
 *
 * The first version reported a problem on almost every leaf, including obviously
 * healthy ones. Four bugs caused that, and each is fixed here:
 *
 *   - **Brightness leaked into every measurement.** Excess Green (`2g-r-b`) grows
 *     with exposure, so a healthy leaf photographed in shade scored as pale and
 *     chlorotic while the same leaf in sun scored fine. Everything now runs on
 *     the *normalised* index `(2g-r-b)/(r+g+b)`, which is invariant to how much
 *     light hit the leaf.
 *   - **Warm light was read as disease.** Indoor bulbs push a green leaf's hue
 *     towards yellow, straight into the chlorosis band. The illuminant is now
 *     estimated from the near-neutral pixels of the backdrop and divided out.
 *   - **The leaf's own outline was counted as damage.** Texture was measured
 *     across the whole mask, so the high-contrast boundary between leaf and
 *     background dominated it, and every well-lit photo looked pitted. Texture
 *     and uniformity are now measured on an *eroded* mask that excludes the rim.
 *   - **Thresholds had no dead zone.** Any trace of yellow raised a finding. Each
 *     threshold now has a margin below which a leaf is simply called healthy.
 *
 * Every constant in TUNING was chosen by running tools/health-calibrate.mjs over
 * the reference dataset — see that file for the measured false-positive rate.
 *
 * Everything runs on a downscaled copy, so a 12-megapixel phone photo costs the
 * same as a thumbnail.
